# Welcome to my DevOps - DB Lab!

This project is a consolidation of some training and knowledge from recent years.

The idea is just a laboratory, to test, reinforce what I learned and try to pass on some information to anyone who is interested.

The project consists of setting up a non-complete, but well functional, infrastructure-oriented DevOps environment with CI/CD, pipelines, security, DNS, virtualization, etc. and services such as Cassandra clusters, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.

To achieve this, I gradually build service architectures such as GitLab, Bind9, OpenLDAP, Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible, Register, etc.

I go slowly from one training session to another in my free time, I have limited hardware resources, so some of the lab features may take a while to complete.

The first installations will be manual for two reasons:

1.  Knowledge of installations, configurations and maintenance is also required.
2.  These first services are necessary for automations.

The project is still in a very early version, completely draft, I still go back and change a lot of information, resources or how to do it. That’s why it hasn’t been translated yet.

I called this project  **DevOps-DB.**

Any help or cooperation is welcome.

I know that many services don’t have all the best practices or security rules and I don’t even intend to do so, there is still a lot to learn, and for a LAB, now, what matters is that it works.

All posts change constantly, I go back and rewrite, as I always have something to improve, change, etc.

## Notes:

Whatever code, files, configuration, etc. on the site is in this repository, separated by technology, with the exception of some folders below:

**knowledge-base** = These are code snippets from the area: https://devops-db.com/category/knowledge-base/

**Work ToD** = These are drafts, notes, temporary files, so I don't forget what I'm still going to do, so I can leave some notes so I have space to evolve and mature some ideas. It is a completely temporary space.

**infrastructure** = It is the internal GitLab mirror.
